# Active-Directory-Home-Lab
<h2>Description</h2>
Will be explaining and demonstrating how I built an On-Premises Domain environment, created a domain controller, and leveraged Splunk for telemetry visualization and effective detection and monitoring.
<br />
<h2>Introduction</h2>
- <b>What Is Active Directory?</b>

- <b>An active directory is simply a database that contains users, computers, groups, and many more. To use an active directory a server must install a service known as active directory domain services and then the server is promoted to a domain controller. Promoting the server to a domain controller will grant the user the capability to perform authentication using Kerberos.</b>



  --<b>What is Splunk?</b>

- <b>Splunk is known to be a data analytics platform that allows organizations to transform machine-generated data into actionable insights in real-time. It enables organizations to gain worthwhile insights from the massive amounts of data generated by their IT systems, applications, and servers.</b>

<h2>Table of Contents</h2>

- <b>Step 1: Installation and Setup (VMware, Ubuntu, Windows 10, Windows Server 22)</b> 
- <b>Step 2: Install and Configure Splunk</b>
- <b>Step 3: Configure Sysmon and Splunk Universal onto Windows Target Machine and Windows Server to send data to Splunk</b>
- <b>Step 4: Configure Active Directory on Windows Server & Promote Domain Controller</b>
- <b>Step 5: Configure Windows Target Machine to Join Newly Created Domain</b>
- <b>Step 6: Brute Force Attack Using Kali Linux to View Telemetry in Splunk</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)
