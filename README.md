# Active-Directory-Home-Lab
<h2>Description</h2>
Will be explaining and demonstrating how I built an On-Premises Domain environment, created a domain controller, and leveraged Splunk for telemetry visualization and effective detection and monitoring.
<br />
<h2>Introduction</h2>
- <b>What Is Active Directory?</b>

- <b>An active directory is simply a database that contains users, computers, groups, and many more. To use an active directory a server must install a service known as active directory domain services and then the server is promoted to a domain controller. Promoting the server to a domain controller will grant the user the capability to perform authentication using Kerberos.</b>





  --<b>What is Splunk?</b>

- <b>Splunk is known to be a data analytics platform that allows organizations to transform machine-generated data into actionable insights in real-time. It enables organizations to gain worthwhile insights from the massive amounts of data generated by their IT systems, applications, and servers.</b>

<h2>Table of Contents</h2>

- <b>Step 1: Installation and Setup (VMware, Ubuntu, Windows 10, Windows Server 22)</b> 
- <b>Step 2: Install and Configure Splunk</b>
- <b>Step 3: Configure Sysmon and Splunk Universal onto Windows Target Machine and Windows Server to send data to Splunk</b>
- <b>Step 4: Configure Active Directory on Windows Server & Promote Domain Controller</b>
- <b>Step 5: Configure Windows Target Machine to Join Newly Created Domain</b>
- <b>Step 6: Brute Force Attack Using Kali Linux to View Telemetry in Splunk</b>

- <b>Network Information ~ For this aspect, I configured everything using NAT (Network Address Translation) as the network type for this project because it allows for internet connectivity among virtual machines while maintaining their isolation</b>
- <b>Target machine ~ Installed and configured Splunk universal forwarder for data transmission, Sysmon to collect telemetry to send over to Splunk.</b>
- <b>Attacker machine ~ Installed and configured Kali Linux for testing purposes</b>
- <b>Splunk Server ~ Installed and configured Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 to host Splunk</b>
- <b>Active Directory ~ Manage users accounts</b>


<h2>Environments Used </h2>
- <b>VMWare</b>
- <b>Windows 10</b>
- <b>Kali Linux</b>
- <b>Active Directory</b>
- <b>Splunk</b>

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

- <b>Step 1: Installation and Setup</b>

- <b>In this lab, all the virtual machines will be hosted in a VMware workstation.</b>
- <b>Install VMware</b>
- <b>To install, I clicked the link below, navigated to the image shown & clicked Download now.</b>
- <b>https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro/workstation-pro-evaluation.html</b>

<br />
<br />
- <b>Once Downloaded, opened it through my computer folder, followed through and installed.</b>
- <b>Install Windows 10</b>
- <b>Navigated to the link below. Scrolled down and clicked on Download tool now</b>
- <b>https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/software-download/windows10</b>

<br />
<br />

- <b>Once downloaded, I selected Create Installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO File), etc</b>
- <b>Clicked next and left everything default</b>
- <b>For Choose Which media to use I selected the ISO file and hit next</b>
- <b>Saved it to a folder of my choice</b>

<br />
<br />

- <b>Now that Windows 10 has been installed on our actual computer, itâ€™s time to open the ISO file in VMware and create our Target machine</b>

<br />

- <b>Located where I saved the Windows 10 ISO file by clicking browse and selecting it</b>

<br />
<br />

- <b>In this case, I labeled it Windows 10. Alternatively, you can call it target machine for ease of reference</b>
